          "id": "subjective_value",
          "title": "Subjective Theory of Value",
          "description": "Value is not inherent in objects but determined by individual preferences and circumstances",
          "explanation": "Unlike classical economics which suggests value comes from labor or production costs, Austrian economics recognizes that value is subjective. A bottle of water has different value to someone in a desert versus someone by a lake.",
          "bitcoin_connection": "Bitcoin's value is purely subjective - it has no intrinsic value but derives worth from what people are willing to trade for it.",
          "key_thinker": "Carl Menger",
          "quote": "Value is not inherent in goods, but rather in the relationship between goods and the human beings who use them."
        },
        {
          "id": "marginal_utility",
          "title": "Marginal Utility",
          "description": "The value of each additional unit of a good decreases as supply increases",
          "explanation": "The first unit of a good provides the highest satisfaction, with each additional unit providing less satisfaction. This explains why prices fall as supply increases.",
          "bitcoin_connection": "Bitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million means each additional Bitcoin becomes more valuable as adoption grows, creating deflationary pressure.",
          "key_thinker": "William Stanley Jevons",
          "quote": "The degree of utility varies with the quantity of commodity, and ultimately decreases as that quantity increases."
        },
        {
          "id": "time_preference",
          "title": "Time Preference",
          "description": "People prefer present goods over future goods, requiring interest as compensation for waiting",
          "explanation": "Individuals naturally prefer to consume now rather than later. Interest rates reflect this time preference and coordinate savings with investment.",
          "bitcoin_connection": "Bitcoin's deflationary nature rewards those with low time preference who save rather than spend, aligning with Austrian principles of sound money.",
          "key_thinker": "Eugen von BÃ¶hm-Bawerk",
          "quote": "Present goods are worth more than future goods of the same kind and quantity."

          "id": "entrepreneurship",
          "title": "Entrepreneurial Discovery",
          "description": "Entrepreneurs discover and exploit profit opportunities through alertness to market conditions",
          "explanation": "Entrepreneurs don't just respond to existing demand but create new value by discovering unmet needs and coordinating resources.",
          "bitcoin_connection": "Satoshi Nakamoto was the ultimate entrepreneur, discovering the opportunity for decentralized digital money and coordinating the development of Bitcoin.",
          "key_thinker": "Israel Kirzner",
          "quote": "Entrepreneurship is the alertness to hitherto unnoticed opportunities."

          "id": "sound_money",
          "title": "Sound Money Principles",
          "description": "Money should be scarce, divisible, portable, durable, and resistant to political manipulation",
          "explanation": "Sound money maintains its purchasing power over time and serves as a reliable medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value.",
          "bitcoin_connection": "Bitcoin embodies sound money principles: scarce (21M cap), divisible (to 8 decimal places), portable (digital), durable (immutable), and resistant to manipulation.",
          "key_thinker": "Ludwig von Mises",
          "quote": "The sound-money principle has two aspects. It is affirmative in approving the market's choice of a commonly used medium of exchange. It is negative in disapproving the government's propensity to meddle with the currency system."

          "title": "Inflation as Hidden Taxation",
          "description": "Money printing transfers wealth from savers to debtors and the government without explicit legislation",
          "explanation": "When central banks create new money, they dilute the purchasing power of existing money, effectively taxing those who hold cash while benefiting those who can access new money first.",
          "bitcoin_connection": "Bitcoin's fixed supply eliminates the possibility of inflation tax, protecting savers and ensuring fair distribution of monetary rewards.",
          "key_thinker": "Milton Friedman",
          "quote": "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon in the sense that it is and can be produced only by a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output."

          "title": "Austrian Business Cycle Theory",
          "description": "Artificially low interest rates create unsustainable booms followed by inevitable busts",
          "explanation": "When central banks suppress interest rates below market levels, they encourage malinvestment in long-term projects that aren't economically viable, leading to economic cycles.",
          "bitcoin_connection": "Bitcoin's predictable monetary policy eliminates artificial interest rate manipulation, potentially reducing economic volatility and business cycles.",
          "key_thinker": "Friedrich Hayek",
          "quote": "The boom which leads to the crisis is not the result of too much saving, but of too much investment."
